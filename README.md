Genre: first person with sword(attacking) and shield(blocking?).

The sword is the cane the old man gave you from a barrel of canes. 

(The old man rummaging around the cane to find the right cane? Tops of the canes sticking out of the barrel as soon as he takes off the lid. Saying “what do you mean you can’t fight of the goblins?”)

The shield is the lid from the barrels of canes

 # Implementing Core Mechanics
 
## Main Character & Controls (Teresa Newman)

Create a main character with animations and proper collider setup.(done)

Map input controls to movement using Godot's Input System.(done)

Ensure smooth interaction between the main character and the game world.(done)

## NPCs & MOBs (Aaron Thomas Roberts)

Design at least one NPCs with meaningful interactions (dialogue, item exchange, etc.). (done)

Program at least two MOBs with non-random behaviors (e.g., patrolling, attacking, reacting to the player). (done)

Implement AI navigation so the NPC and MOBs respond dynamically to the environment. (done)

## Game Physics & Event Triggers (Devon Sabody)

Use vectors to control movement, acceleration, and forces applied to objects. (done)

Create an event that triggers based on the player’s actions and occurs some distance away from them. (done)

## Level Design & Navigation (Teresa Newman, Aaron Thomas Roberts, Devon Sabody)

Develop at least one full playable level that includes:

A structured environment with interactive elements. (done)

A Navigation Mesh Agent for AI characters to move intelligently. (done)

A cutscene before the level begins and one at the end of the level (both success and failure endings). (done)
